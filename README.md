# CV_20240327_prng
A pet project for CV. Initialised 20240327.
Project will make a XORshift Pseudo Random Number Generator

Plan:
First mini project will be a "proof of concept" to check that the compiler works on this machine (so I can say hello world etc), and that I indeed have something that might resemble a real pseudo random number generator (PRNG).
Next miniproject will be to measure runtime.
Next miniproject will be to test how good it is as a prng - method selected was monte carlo approximation of pi.

Result:
Managed to find a working compiler.
Generated some random numbers.
Measured execution time and approximated pi to 3 significant figures (see attached picture).
