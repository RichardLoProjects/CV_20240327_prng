# CV_20240327_prng
A pet project for CV. Initialised 20240327.
Project will make a XORshift Pseudo Random Number Generator

First mini project will be a "proof of concept" to check that the compiler works on this machine (so I can say hello world etc), and that I indeed have something that might resemble a real pseudo random number generator (PRNG).

Next miniproject will be to measure runtime
Next miniproject will be to test it is actually a PRNG (maybe a histogram or diehard test)
